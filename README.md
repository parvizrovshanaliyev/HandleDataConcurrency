# Handle Data Concurrency




This code demonstrates how to handle data concurrency issues when generating document numbers in a document management system.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK
- Entity Framework Core

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url
   ```

2. Build the solution:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Code Explanation - Document Numbering

### `IDocumentService` Interface

This interface defines the contract for the document service. It contains two methods: `CreateDocumentAsync` and `GenerateDocNumberAsync`.

### `DocumentService` Class

This class implements the `IDocumentService` interface and provides the functionality to create documents and generate document numbers.

#### `CreateDocumentAsync` Method

This method creates a new document with a generated document number. It follows the following steps:
1. Determine the budget code and document type.
2. Generate the document number by calling the `GenerateDocNumberAsync` method.
3. Create a new `Document` object with the provided document type and set the status to "Waiting".
4. Set the document number obtained from the `GenerateDocNumberAsync` method on the document.
5. Add the document to the database context.
6. Save the changes to the database.

#### `GenerateDocNumberAsync` Method

This method generates a unique document number based on the document type, prefix, and budget code. It handles concurrency issues using a retry mechanism. The steps involved are:
1. Set the maximum retry count and initialize the retry count and success flag.
2. Get the current year for the document number.
3. Enter a retry loop to handle concurrency issues.
4. Check if a previous document number exists for the given document type, budget code, and year.
5. If no previous document number exists, create a new one with the provided document type, year, and budget code. Set the sequence number to 1.
6. If a previous document number exists, increment the sequence number and update the last document number.
7. Save the changes to the database.
8. Set the success flag to true and return the formatted document number.

## Conclusion

This code demonstrates how to handle data concurrency issues when generating document numbers in a document management system. By implementing proper concurrency handling techniques, you can ensure the integrity and uniqueness of document numbers in a multi-user environment.
